Hello, Arweave!

This is a sample file for testing the Harlequin Remote Signing Library.

The library provides a simple way to upload data for signing and automatically handles:
- Server startup and management
- DataItem creation with proper tags and anchors
- Browser opening for wallet signing
- Waiting for signing completion
- DataItem ID extraction
- Automatic bundler upload

This makes it easy to integrate remote signing into any Go application!
